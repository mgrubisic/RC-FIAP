# RC-FIAP
The open virtual platform RC-FIAP, developed in Python, with the analysis library OpenSeesPy at its core, is presented to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of different archetypes of reinforced concrete frames, including ACI318 compliant structures. The platform is a tool for educational performance-based earthquake engineering, including research capabilities for risk assessment. In the first phase of the platform presented here, the fragility assessment is carried in a few seconds from conception to pushover analysis, including design and construction of the nonlinear model. Input variables include number of stories and spans, material properties (steel, concrete), dimensioning of beams and columns, gravity loading, seismic design parameters per ASCE 7-16, and choice of design detailing per ACI318-19. The GUI-based platform allows studying the impact of these variables in the performance of frames, by including ASCE/SEI 41-17 acceptance criteria.
